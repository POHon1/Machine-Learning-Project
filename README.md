### Computer-Vision-Projects

*Many Data science projects revolve around solving real-world problems using Data analysis using Machine learning. Whether predicting customer churn, detecting fraud, estimating house prices, or classifying medical conditions, the goal remains the same: turning raw data into actionable insights using ML algorithm. Commonly used techniques in these projects is XGBoost. 

**The key in Data Science is having the right data and the right approach—XGBoost takes care of the rest. (My opinion)**
